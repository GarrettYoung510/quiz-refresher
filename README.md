# [Small Quiz for Front End Developers](https://garrettyoung510.github.io/quiz-refresher/)

## Reasoning/Motivation

Built as a refresher on front end topics

## Technologies Used
* Vanilla JS 
* Real DOM manipulation
* Window Manipulation methods (scrollTo, preventDefault)
* Animation (setInterval for score calculation effect)
* Bootstrap 

## Challenges

* Coming up with questions and answers, now I know the struggle that test makers come up with and I hope my answers were not too obvious in comparison with other answers
* Refresher on window manipulation methods and vanilla JS as I have been using ES6+ with React/Redux

## Next Steps

* Adding more questions
* Making the code more dynamic and reusable
